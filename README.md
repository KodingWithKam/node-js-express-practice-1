NodeJS Express Practice 1

1. Created npm project and installed express and nodemon
2. Created express app which funnels requests through 2 middleware functions that log something
to console and return one response
3. Handle requests to '/' and '/users' such that each request has only one handler/middleware
that does something with it (send response)
